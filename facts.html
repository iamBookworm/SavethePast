      <ul>
      <li>Majority of the garbage that enters the ocean each year is plastic among eight million metric tons of the plastic items we toss
      (instead of recycle), won’t biodegrade. Instead, they can persist in the environment for a millennium, polluting our beaches, entangling marine life.</li>
      <li>Today’s seas absorb as much as a quarter of all man-made carbon emissions, which changes the pH of surface waters and leads to acidification. This
      problem is rapidly worsening—oceans are now acidifying faster than they have in some 300 million years.</li>

      <p>AIR:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>These two are the most prevalent types of air pollution. Smog, or “ground-level ozone,”, occurs when emissions from combusting fossil fuels react
      with sunlight. Soot, or “particulate matter,” is made up of tiny particles of chemicals, soil, smoke, dust, or allergens, in the form of gas or
      solids, that are carried in the air.</li>
      <li>Mold and allergens from trees, weeds, and grass are also carried in the air, are exacerbated by climate change, and can be hazardous to health.
      They are not regulated by the government and are less directly connected to human actions, but they can be considered air pollution.</li>
